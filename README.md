# Trello_to_Pivotal-Tracker

Quick and dirty file import utility to allow Epic & Story creation in Pivotal Tracker from Trello Cards + Checklists. Input is Trello cards exported as JSON files, and output is two CSV files - the 1st containing Epics, and the 2nd containing their Stories. Users are also prompted to enter a unique label (preferably short) for each Epic.
